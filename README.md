PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will use a binary search tree to implement a guessing game (similar to 20 questions). The program will initially have a few simple questions built in that it will ask the user. The user will respond yes or no to each until the program makes a guess. If the guess is incorrect the program will ask for the user's answer and for the user to input a question to differentiate between what it guessed and the user's answer. The program will then add the question and answer to the tree and ask to play again. In this way the game will be able to update with each playthrough.
